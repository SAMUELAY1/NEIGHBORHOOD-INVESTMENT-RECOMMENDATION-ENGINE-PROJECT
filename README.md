# NEIGHBORHOOD-INVESTMENT-RECOMMENDATION-ENGINE-PROJECT


## üìå Project Overview

The **Neighborhood Investment Recommendation Engine** is a data-driven tool designed to help real estate investors identify the most promising neighborhoods for property investment. By analyzing property listings, price trends, and other neighborhood-level features, the engine ranks areas based on potential Return on Investment (ROI), providing actionable insights for smarter property decisions.

## Purpose

In a rapidly changing real estate market, investors often struggle to find reliable, data-backed signals on where to invest next. This project aims to:

- Empower real estate investors with an intelligent, data-informed ranking system
- Highlight undervalued or emerging neighborhoods
- Forecast future ‚Äúhot zones‚Äù using historical trends and machine learning

##  Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**: Cleansing raw real estate data to create useful metrics like price per square foot, lot size, and price appreciation trends.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Grouping similar neighborhoods using unsupervised machine learning to identify investment archetypes.
- **Neighborhood Scoring System**: Ranking locations based on key indicators such as affordability, growth rate, and housing supply.
- **Time Series Forecasting** *(optional add-on)*: Predicting price trends to surface neighborhoods with high future potential.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Heatmaps, scatter plots, and trend charts to make exploration intuitive.

## Tech Stack

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)**
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for analysis and prototyping
- **Power BI / Tableau** *(optional)* for dashboards

## Dataset

The dataset includes property listings with attributes such as:
- Price, beds, baths, house size, lot size
- Location: city, state, zip code
- Listing status, property type, and broker information

## Target Collaborators

This project welcomes:
- **Data Analysts** for EDA and metric development  
- **ML Engineers** to help with clustering and forecasting  
- **Real Estate Enthusiasts** to provide domain insights  
- **Frontend/Data Viz Designers** to build intuitive dashboards  

## üìà Outcome

By the end of this project, we aim to have:
- A reproducible notebook pipeline
- A ranked list of neighborhoods by investment potential
- Clear, shareable insights through visualizations or a dashboard

# Cleaned Real Estate Dataset
## Neighborhood Investment Project
## Overview
This repository contains a cleaned and pre-processed real estate dataset, curated as part of a larger project: Neighborhood Investment Recommendation Engine. The goal is to enable data-driven insights into property investments by cleaning, enriching, and preparing raw real estate data for deeper exploratory data analysis and modeling.

# What Was Done ‚Äì Data Cleaning Highlights
The original dataset had issues like inconsistent formatting, missing values, and outliers. Here's what was addressed:
## Cleaning Steps:
* Removed duplicates and handled missing values using .dropna() and .fillna() strategies.
* Normalized column formats:
    * Converted price from string ($123,456) to numeric.
    * Parsed house_size, acre_lot, bed, and bath columns into correct numeric formats.
* Formatted categorical fields:
    * Capitalized city names and standardized state names.
    * Converted zip codes to 5-digit strings.
* Converted data types:
    * Changed float columns to integers where appropriate (e.g., bed, bath, price).
* Filtered outliers in price, acre_lot, and bedroom/bathroom counts.
* Set meaningful index for the dataset to facilitate easier querying and joining.

## Dataset Fields After Cleaning
Column Name	Description
price	Sale price of the property
bed	Number of bedrooms
bath	Number of bathrooms
acre_lot	Size of the lot in acres
house_size	Size of the house in square feet
street	Street address
city	City where property is located
state	State where property is located
zip_code	Zip code
brokered_by	Real estate agency
status	Listing status
