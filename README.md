# NEIGHBORHOOD-INVESTMENT-RECOMMENDATION-ENGINE-PROJECT


## üìå Project Overview

The **Neighborhood Investment Recommendation Engine** is a data-driven tool designed to help real estate investors identify the most promising neighborhoods for property investment. By analyzing property listings, price trends, and other neighborhood-level features, the engine ranks areas based on potential Return on Investment (ROI), providing actionable insights for smarter property decisions.

## Purpose

In a rapidly changing real estate market, investors often struggle to find reliable, data-backed signals on where to invest next. This project aims to:

- Empower real estate investors with an intelligent, data-informed ranking system
- Highlight undervalued or emerging neighborhoods
- Forecast future ‚Äúhot zones‚Äù using historical trends and machine learning

##  Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**: Cleansing raw real estate data to create useful metrics like price per square foot, lot size, and price appreciation trends.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Grouping similar neighborhoods using unsupervised machine learning to identify investment archetypes.
- **Neighborhood Scoring System**: Ranking locations based on key indicators such as affordability, growth rate, and housing supply.
- **Time Series Forecasting** *(optional add-on)*: Predicting price trends to surface neighborhoods with high future potential.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Heatmaps, scatter plots, and trend charts to make exploration intuitive.

## Tech Stack

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)**
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for analysis and prototyping
- **Power BI / Tableau** *(optional)* for dashboards

## Dataset

The dataset includes property listings with attributes such as:
- Price, beds, baths, house size, lot size
- Location: city, state, zip code
- Listing status, property type, and broker information

## Target Collaborators

This project welcomes:
- **Data Analysts** for EDA and metric development  
- **ML Engineers** to help with clustering and forecasting  
- **Real Estate Enthusiasts** to provide domain insights  
- **Frontend/Data Viz Designers** to build intuitive dashboards  

## üìà Outcome

By the end of this project, we aim to have:
- A reproducible notebook pipeline
- A ranked list of neighborhoods by investment potential
- Clear, shareable insights through visualizations or a dashboard
